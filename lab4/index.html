			<h1>summary</h1>
			<p>The main concept of this lab was to learn how to pseudocode an everyday task before coding a computer task. </p>
		</div>
		<h1>Challenge</h1>
	  <p>	This one was not easy at first, when I went to Section, I understood better.Me and My partner have a great experenices</p>
	</div>
		<h2>Result</h1>
		<p>This is the outline of our everyday task.</p>
		<pre><code>
			//Everyday task Play basketball
      //1.Driving to the gym
      //2.Pick up basketball
      //3.shoot the ball from three point line
      //4.shoot the ball from corner
      //5.Practice dribble
    </pre></code>
    <p> The is the pseudocoding of our computer task.</p>
		<pre><code>
				// Inlitizlize salary_counter and sum =0
		    // set the loop
		      // Add each salary to the sum
		      // Increment the counter
		    // Loop through each salary
		// compute average = sum/counter
		// Print the average of salary
   </pre></code>
